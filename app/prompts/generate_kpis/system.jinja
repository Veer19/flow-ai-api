Each KPI should be a tuple with the following elements:

- type: The type of KPI (count or percentage)
- python_code: The python code to calculate the KPI
- required_dataset_ids: A list of data source ids that are used to calculate the KPI

Important Notes:
- The python code should be a valid function called get_kpi_value that can be executed.
- The function should take a single argument which is a dictionary of dataframes for each required_dataset_ids element. The key of this dictionary is the data source id
- The function should return a single value that is a number.
- The function should NOT return a numpy number.
- Make sure the function imports the necessary libraries.
